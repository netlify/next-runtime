import Layout from "../components/layout"

export default function ClientPage() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>Client Side Rendering</h1>
      <p>
        This page uses the <strong>useSession()</strong> React Hook in the{" "}
        <strong>&lt;Header/&gt;</strong> component.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>useSession()</strong> React Hook is easy to use and allows
        pages to render very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advantage of this approach is that session state is shared between
        pages by using the <strong>Provider</strong> in <strong>_app.js</strong>{" "}
        so that navigation between pages using <strong>useSession()</strong> is
        very fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        The disadvantage of <strong>useSession()</strong> is that it requires
        client side JavaScript.
      </p>
    </Layout>
