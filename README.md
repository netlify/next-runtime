This build plugin is a utility for supporting Next.js on Netlify. To enable server-side rendering and other framework-specific features in your Next.js application on Netlify, you will need to install this plugin for your app.

## Installation and Configuration

There are two ways to install the plugin in your Next.js on Netlify site.

**Option 1: UI-based Installation**

This plugin can be installed and managed from your site's settings on Netlify.

[ðŸ‘‰ Click to install this plugin ðŸ‘ˆ](http://app.netlify.com/plugins/@netlify/plugin-nextjs/install)

Read more about [UI-based plugin installation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/#ui-installation) in our docs.

**Option 2: File-based Installation**

Create a `netlify.toml` in the root of your project. Your file should include the plugins section below:

```toml
[build]
  command   = "npm run build"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
```

Read more about [file-based plugin installation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/#file-based-installation) in our docs.

## Custom Netlify Functions

This plugin creates one Netlify Function for each Next.js page that requires one.
To use custom Netlify Functions in addition to what the plugin generates, add a path to your functions folder in `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[build]
  command   = "npm run build"
  functions = "my_functions_dir"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
```

Read more about [Netlify Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/) in our docs.

## Publish Directory

Similarly, you can customize your publish directory in your `netlify.toml` file:

```toml
[build]
  command   = "npm run build"
  functions = "my_functions_dir"
  publish   = "my_publish_dir"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
```

Read more about [Netlify's build settings](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/#basic-build-settings) in our docs.

## Custom Netlify Redirects

You can define custom redirects in a `_redirects` file.
The precedence of these rules are:

- `_redirects`
- `next-on-netlify` redirects

Read more about [Netlify redirects](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/) in our docs.

## Caveats

### Versions

You can check our `package.json` for supported Next and Node versions. Our support of Next 10 is currently experimental.

### CLI

This plugin is currently not stable for use with the Netlify CLI. Support for the plugin is in development.

### Fallbacks for Pages with `getStaticPaths`

[Fallback pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#fallback-true) behave differently with this plugin than they do with Next.js. On Next.js, when navigating to a path that is not defined in `getStaticPaths`, it first displays the fallback page. Next.js then generates the HTML in the background and caches it for future requests.

With this plugin, when navigating to a path that is not defined in `getStaticPaths`, it server-side renders the page and sends it directly to the user. The user never sees the fallback page. The page is not cached for future requests.
