## What's new in this version

Version 4 is a complete rewrite of the Essential Next.js plugin. For full details of everything that's new, check out
[the v4 release notes](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-nextjs/blob/main/docs/release-notes/v4.md)

## Installing the plugin

The plugin installs automatically for new Next.js sites on Netlify. You can also install it manually like this:

```shell
npm install -D @netlify/plugin-nextjs
```

...then add the plugin to your `netlify.toml` file:

```toml
[[plugins]]
package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
```

## Migrating from an older version of the plugin

You can manually upgrade from the previous version of the plugin by running the following command:

```shell
npm install -D @netlify/plugin-nextjs@latest
```

Change the `publish` directory to `.next`:

```toml
[build]
publish = ".next"
```

If you previously set these values, they're no longer needed and can be removed:

- `distDir` in your `next.config.js`
- `node_bundler = "esbuild"` in `netlify.toml`
- `external_node_modules` in `netlify.toml`

The `serverless` and `experimental-serverless-trace` targets are deprecated in Next 12, and all builds with this plugin
will now use the default `server` target. If you previously set the target in your `next.config.js`, you should remove
it.

If you currently use redirects or rewrites on your site, see
[the Rewrites and Redirects guide](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-nextjs/blob/main/docs/redirects-rewrites.md)
for information on changes to how they are handled in this version.

If you want to use Next 12's beta Middleware feature, this will mostly work as expected but please
[read the docs on some caveats and workarounds](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-nextjs/blob/main/docs/middleware.md)
that are currently needed.

## Monorepos

If you are using a monorepo you will need to change `publish` to point to the full path to the built `.next` directory,
which may be in a subdirectory. If you have changed your `distDir` then it will need to match that.

If you are using Nx, then you will need to point `publish` to the folder inside `dist`, e.g. `dist/apps/myapp/.next`.

## Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

The Essential Next.js plugin now fully supports ISR on Netlify. For more details see
[the ISR docs](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-nextjs/blob/main/docs/isr.md).

## Use with `next export`

If you are using `next export` to generate a static site, you do not need most of the functionality of this plugin and
you can remove it. Alternatively you can
[set the environment variable](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/)
`NETLIFY_NEXT_PLUGIN_SKIP` to `true` and the plugin will handle caching but won't generate any functions for SSR
support. See [`demos/next-export`](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-nextjs/tree/main/demos/next-export) for an
example.

## Generated functions

This plugin works by generating three Netlify functions that handle requests that haven't been pre-rendered. These are
`___netlify-handler` (for SSR and API routes), `___netlify-odb-handler` (for ISR and fallback routes), and `_ipx` (for
images). You can see the requests for these in [the function logs](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/logs/). For ISR
and fallback routes you will not see any requests that are served from the edge cache, just actual rendering requests.
These are all internal functions, so you won't find them in your site's own functions directory.

## Feedback

If you think you have found a bug in the plugin,
[please open an issue](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-nextjs/issues). If you have comments or feature
requests, [see the dicussion board](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-nextjs/discussions)
