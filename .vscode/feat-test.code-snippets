{
	// Place your netlify-plugin-nextjs workspace snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Create Next Test Feature": {
		"scope": "javascriptreact,typescriptreact",
		"prefix": "ft",
		"body": [
			"import Link from 'next/link'",
			"",
			"function $1() {",
			"\treturn (",
			"\t\t<div>",
			"\t\t<h1>$1</h1>",
			"\t\t<Link href=\"\"><a>Read Docs</a></Link>",
			"\t\t<p>Description of feature</p>",
			"\t\t<p>Example/test of feature</p>",
			"\t\t</div>",
			"\t)",
			"}",
			"",
			"export default $1"
