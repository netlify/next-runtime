/**
 * Na√Øve linear packing algorithm.
 * Takes items with weights, and packs them into boxes of a given threshold.
 * If an item weight exceeds the threshold, it is put into a box of its own.
 * 
 * We're using this to combine many API Routes into fewer Lambda functions.
 * 
 * This does not compute an optimal solution.
 * For that, we'd take the full dependency graph into account
 * and try to pack routes with intersecting dependencies together.
 * But since most of the lambda bundle consists of node_modules,
 * that probably won't help much.
 * In the future, we might think about using some graph-based analysis here!
 * Too complicated for now.
