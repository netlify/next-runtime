We use [Conventional Commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to automate version management.

Most common commit message prefixes are:

- `fix:` which represents bug fixes, and generate a patch release.
- `feat:` which represents a new feature, and generate a minor release.
- `feat!:`, `fix!:` or `refactor!:` and generate a major release.
